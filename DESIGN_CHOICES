1) As a matter of design choice, there are a few items that could be performed in a single
salt formula, that instead are divided into multiple .sls files.

For example: The 3 rules governing /etc/shadow could be written as:

/etc/shadow:
 file.managed:
  - user: root
  - group: root
  - mode: 0000

but has been divided into 3 different .sls files, since they are divided into 3 separate rules by the STIG.
This may change in the future if I re-organize the way I handle the rules( and I probably will) but currently
that is how they will be organized, to make it easier to find the rule you are looking for.

2) I've decided not to run "yum updates" on the system, as required by one of the STIG items
in order to prevent this formula from interfering with a Systems normal patching schedule.
